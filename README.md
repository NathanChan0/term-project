CSCI-1020 Term Bioinformatics project

The two programs finds the longest common subsequence(LCS) of two DNA sequences

Either program can be have an input of 2 DNA strings with the bases 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'T'. 
It can also random generate 2 strings at a selected length by inputting n = # as the input
If there is no input 2 strings are randomly generated at a length of 12

term_DP prints out the two strings, alignment table, the LCS, and the length of the LCS
term_RE prints out just the length of the LCS
